A place for meetings and acquaintances, a poetic workshop, a club, and a library for the creative youth of the 1960s. Today, we would call Svitlychnyi a guru of networking and community building.**
On September 28-29, we will meet at the platform ""Ostriv,"" which is a local cultural center in Chokolivka, to celebrate the birthday of a neighbor from the past and talk about the sixtieths in broader contexts. This is all that matters to us now - attitudes towards the Soviet legacy, activism and solidarity networks, memory and commemoration practices, ultimately - how new media help to understand the past. In addition to the educational component, the festival will also include creative workshops from the residents of the ""Ostriv"" platform, the content of which will address various figures and dimensions of the sixtieths, particularly artistic ones.

""Svitlychnyk"" first took place in 2020 as an intimate event for the neighborhood community aimed at communicating the emergence of Ivan Svitlychnyi Street in Chokolivka. The next event was held as a literary evening for young authors. During the full-scale war, we continue this commemorative practice in the district space, scaling it up to a mini-festival.
