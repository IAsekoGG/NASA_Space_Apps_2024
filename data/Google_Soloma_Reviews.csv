Modern and definitely has a personality. The front desk staff were nice and the atmosphere is fun.

Our room was very nice. Bed was quite firm, and pillows were ok, maybe a little soft for my taste.

The location is near a nice mall with lots of world-brand stores and ice skating...and that includes one of the largest grocery stores I have ever been to in my life. If you need to get down to the city center, that's going to take 20-30 minutes by car.

The reason they lose a star is that I found the hotel to be quite noisy at night. Aside from easily hearing guests talking in the halls, and whatever the neighbors might be ""doing"" in their room, the doors slam shut and it is quite loud. This is compounded by the fact that the halls are long and that creates an echo. If you read through other reviews, there isn't much mention of this, so maybe the issue is ""me..."" But, I'd just say if you're a light sleeper, you might want to consider a different hotel.",1628952319,False

When we called at check-in time at 1:30 p.m., they answered that they were currently looking for available apartments and would call back without providing more detailed information. Ok, we are waiting and so are the other guests. After 10 minutes of calling again, they heard back the reason that the delay in cleaning would take 10-15 minutes. At 14.45 another person called and said that they had an overlay and there was another option in the same house. To do this, you need to go to the second section and the person whose number was reset by message will be waiting there.
In the meantime, we went to have lunch at an establishment in the same building. And they have already chosen another place. Being still at the address, we decided to see what was on offer. When we approached, no one was waiting, we called the number and found out that we needed to leave money to the security guard first, without seeing the apartment we were being changed to, without even seeing a photo, then that a driver’s license was not suitable, we only needed the original passport and in general, no I like it - “figure it out for yourself.” This conversation ended at 15.00. After such “fun” we went and stopped in another place. No one else from this place called.
And besides, an hour and a half spent on the spot, time and financial costs for transport to the place, from the apartment to another place. Choosing another place ""hot"".

Change your name, because you haven't heard of the Hippocratic Oath! Today at around 18:20 I was returning home from work (I was sick all day, I won't list what and how) near the Fora store at Havela 4, I felt very sick, to the point that I had a momentary feeling of fear of death. .I understand that I will not reach the house. Dizziness, my eyes darken, I can't feel my arms, legs, frantic heartbeat, chest pain...I start breathing deeply...controlling myself little by little, my hands are shaking, I google the work schedule of ""Hippocrates"" because I'm local and always knew that she is here. I see it written in Google ""Opened"". I go there, go up the stairs, the door is closed. I call the operators' numbers - they don't answer, but I feel so bad that I still call the landline without losing hope:
- Hello ""Hippocrates""
- Hello, good day? are you open
- Yes, they are open
- How to get to you? It's closed here.
- uh...mmmm...well, the administrator is there, she left, and there are no records at all for today!!
- I'm not on the record, I'm passing, it's very bad, please, I just need to measure the pressure
- and the pressure? ok, wait a bit, I will clarify (on the line)
- I'm waiting.
- Sorry, we do not provide services to passers-by.
- But please, I feel very bad. Really very...
- Well, sorry, unfortunately not

Sorry. I am aware that the clinic is private, paid, has its own rules, etc. But how? Tell me how? You can refuse a person who says ""I'm at your door, please just measure the pressure, it just excludes me very badly"" at that moment I was ready to pay a lot of money so that in this moment of fear, someone from the doctors was with me... although b before arrival 103.
Why does the clinic not indicate on its website that it is closed ""for passers-by""? And why is it basically closed there, if the opening hours are indicated until 11:00 p.m.

A clinic with the name ""Hippocrates"", but as it turned out, behind such a beautiful, loud name is indifference.

If you at least partially share my disappointment, have a conversation with the team...
So that in the future it would be at least ""Sorry, our website states that everything is by appointment only, we cannot help you. You can familiarize yourself."" Or instead of ""We do not serve passers-by"" - we do not have such a service to measure blood pressure. Then there would be no questions...

Not when: - ""Excuse me, I'm a policeman, I'm in uniform, I think I'm going to fall right here right now....please..."" (more likely, I just wanted someone to come to me, and I was confident in the doctors)💔
- eeee...No, I'm sorry...well, unfortunately

I understand that you are not 103
But that's all, it's too...

Maybe because Kyiv is the capital of Ukraine?.. And is it normal to rent a room for 580 hryvnia, with an air temperature of +6 and an open window upon check-in?…
At the same time, I’ll immediately note that parking is paid +100 hryvnia per night!
It all started with an uneducated guy at the reception who has no idea what you’re up to...
All check-in takes place over the phone, a guy talks to you on the phone and tells you where to go and give money for the room.
And the one who accepts the money knows a little, but if something happens, he doesn’t have change, so if the room rate is 580, you automatically give him tea for 20 hryvnia.
Well, these are trifles, then the number.
When checking in, I need to go through another half of the building and find the second entrance, which was indicated by the guy from the reception.
Next, you take the elevator up an ordinary residential building and look for your room for about 10 minutes.
When I opened the already tired door, I found myself in a room in which the temperature was not particularly different from the temperature at the entrance to the building. I further noted that the window in the room was open, most likely to remove the unpleasant odor that had enveloped the entire room; well, this does not really help save the situation.
The whole room looks like a station dump car.
With stale bed linen, which you don’t want to sit on even in a jacket and jeans...
Again, everything is decided over the phone.
I did not continue exploring this place and returned the money.
It’s a pity that I wasted my time; I had to travel from Kyiv at night without resting.
I do not recommend it 200%!",1640158071,True

Im the owner of SaigonDance in Viet Nam. I had the chance to visit Kiev and by chance was involved in Myway Dance Academy course.

I really enjoyed the course and it inspired me so much: The school is organized very well with professional reception area, bathroom, changing room, canteen, 9 or 10 dance studios with different size and different mobile-funtions. Especially, the school usually hosts many nice events for students under the surveilance of dynamic marketing team. I had many good friends in the class. I still remember the first day I appeared at the entrance of the class (Well, such an ashamed but I got some problems so I was late), all the class said Hi to me and after the class time, they came and asked if I need any help, feel free to tell them. They are very united, focused on the class and studied so hard that made me admire so much. In addition, the teachers are very qualified. Even the class schedule is quite tight but noone showed off their tiredness or boredom. Instead, the teachers tried to give as much as possilbe their knowledge and passion of dancing for students. There are some teachers I especially like their dance styles or teaching method that – sorry- I can’t remember the Ukrainian name (mr Vobr, the Dance hall teacher, the House teacher, the Break dance teacher,….). Lastly, the academy was organized in 3 months, 6 days per week, 6 hours per day with a very supportive price – as I remember just only around 500usd. It’s very very low price that I know Myway can’t make much profit from this Academy.

I’m the only foreigner in the course. As I heard that many foreigners are scared of the safety and language in the country. I was the same but after crossing nearly 10 countries in the North of Europe,  I felt in love of Kiev – very beautiful, peaceful, safe and good food at very reasonable price.

In conclusion, I would love to express my special thanks to Myway staff, teachers and especially my classmate who helped me so well in this lonely period of time in your country. Love you all and suggest other dancers in the world should join this special training course: GOOD QUALITY, WELL – ORGANIZED, LOW PRICE, BEAUTIFUL CITY.",1566131663,False
