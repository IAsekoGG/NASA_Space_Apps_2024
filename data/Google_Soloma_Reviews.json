                "text": "This is a great place to stay. Modern and definitely has a personality. The front desk staff were nice and the atmosphere is fun.\n\nOur room was very nice. Bed was quite firm, and pillows were ok, maybe a little soft for my taste.\n\nThe location is near a nice mall with lots of world-brand stores and ice skating...and that includes one of the largest grocery stores I have ever been to in my life. If you need to get down to the city center, that's going to take 20-30 minutes by car.\n\nThe reason they lose a star is that I found the hotel to be quite noisy at night. Aside from easily hearing guests talking in the halls, and whatever the neighbors might be \"doing\" in their room, the doors slam shut and it is quite loud. This is compounded by the fact that the halls are long and that creates an echo. If you read through other reviews, there isn't much mention of this, so maybe the issue is \"me...\" But, I'd just say if you're a light sleeper, you might want to consider a different hotel.",

Little bit far from the city center to walk, so can't have a proper evening walk and the area didn't look like roaming around , but metro station was near and public transportation is available as well (even though is not recommended to use). Taxi is cheap, so better use that. Ask the receptionist to help you with taxi calling (uber, bolt or uklon). Shopping center is right behind the hotel. Rooms are small for my taste , but everything is there, clean and neat. Laundry is bit expensive, but free laundry room is always available. 😉",

This place is amazingly filled with all the peripherals you might need and the possibility of trying them out and testing them first hand is something that cannot be compared to any review online! 100 times better than buying from Rozetka for example, where you cannot even try products in most cases. I really really enjoyed the interior of the place as well, it's really well organized and everything is on display in categories. Wide selection and the stuff is in stock for real! It's not in some warehouse outside Kyiv like it often happens with other shops! I was super satisfied and I recommend this place to any gamer and pc enthusiast in Kyiv! They offer also a great selection of gaming chairs, headphones etc! Go to the website and choose what you have, maybe call just to be sure they have it in stock at the store. BTW, One of the really few places in Kyiv with easy parking and easy access.",

When we called at check-in time at 1:30 p.m., they answered that they were currently looking for available apartments and would call back without providing more detailed information. Ok, we are waiting and so are the other guests. After 10 minutes of calling again, they heard back the reason that the delay in cleaning would take 10-15 minutes. At 14.45 another person called and said that they had an overlay and there was another option in the same house. To do this, you need to go to the second section and the person whose number was reset by message will be waiting there.\nIn the meantime, we went to have lunch at an establishment in the same building. And they have already chosen another place. Being still at the address, we decided to see what was on offer. When we approached, no one was waiting, we called the number and found out that we needed to leave money to the security guard first, without seeing the apartment we were being changed to, without even seeing a photo, then that a driver’s license was not suitable, we only needed the original passport and in general, no I like it - “figure it out for yourself.” This conversation ended at 15.00. After such “fun” we went and stopped in another place. No one else from this place called.\nAnd besides, an hour and a half spent on the spot, time and financial costs for transport to the place, from the apartment to another place. Choosing another place \"hot\". Another interesting point is that in case of no-show and cancellation of the reservation, full payment will be charged, as indicated. What can we say about the emotional factor and the moment when time is planned and you are in a hurry to get somewhere.",

But I understood that 30 minutes were allotted for my visit and I took the time of my visit, for which I will pay later. No one called me to ask when I was at the clinic, it turned out that the doctor had accepted the next patient. This is nonsense for private clinics, I have a specific time, and it is only my problems if I am late. They justified it by saying that they wanted me to have 30 minutes of my appointment, so it was as if they switched places. Therefore, I sat waiting in the lobby for 20 minutes until the next appointment, but when the time came, no one accepted me on time, and after 10 minutes I was told that I would have to wait another 15 minutes. 🤷🏼‍♀️\nTerrible service, on the basis of a state polyclinic.

Today at around 18:20 I was returning home from work (I was sick all day, I won't list what and how) near the Fora store at Havela 4, I felt very sick, to the point that I had a momentary feeling of fear of death. .I understand that I will not reach the house. Dizziness, my eyes darken, I can't feel my arms, legs, frantic heartbeat, chest pain...I start breathing deeply...controlling myself little by little, my hands are shaking, I google the work schedule of \"Hippocrates\" because I'm local and always knew that she is here. I see it written in Google \"Opened\". I go there, go up the stairs, the door is closed. I call the operators' numbers - they don't answer, but I feel so bad that I still call the landline without losing hope:\n- Hello \"Hippocrates\"\n- Hello, good day? are you open\n- Yes, they are open\n- How to get to you? It's closed here.\n- uh...mmmm...well, the administrator is there, she left, and there are no records at all for today!!\n- I'm not on the record, I'm passing, it's very bad, please, I just need to measure the pressure\n- and the pressure? ok, wait a bit, I will clarify (on the line)\n- I'm waiting.\n- Sorry, we do not provide services to passers-by.\n- But please, I feel very bad. Really very...\n- Well, sorry, unfortunately not\n\nSorry. I am aware that the clinic is private, paid, has its own rules, etc. But how? Tell me how? You can refuse a person who says \"I'm at your door, please just measure the pressure, it just excludes me very badly\" at that moment I was ready to pay a lot of money so that in this moment of fear, someone from the doctors was with me... although b before arrival 103.\nWhy does the clinic not indicate on its website that it is closed \"for passers-by\"? And why is it basically closed there, if the opening hours are indicated until 11:00 p.m.\n\nA clinic with the name \"Hippocrates\", but as it turned out, behind such a beautiful, loud name is indifference.\n\nIf you at least partially share my disappointment, have a conversation with the team...\nSo that in the future it would be at least \"Sorry, our website states that everything is by appointment only, we cannot help you. You can familiarize yourself.\" Or instead of \"We do not serve passers-by\" - we do not have such a service to measure blood pressure. Then there would be no questions...\n\nNot when: - \"Excuse me, I'm a policeman, I'm in uniform, I think I'm going to fall right here right now....please...\" (more likely, I just wanted someone to come to me, and I was confident in the doctors)💔\n- eeee...No, I'm sorry...well, unfortunately\n\nI understand that you are not 103\nBut that's all, it's too...\n\"We do not serve passers-by\" 💔💔💔",

Having laid out the sofa, there were sparkles, remains of dry food and other debris on it. The stove was dirty, clearly no one had cleaned it after previous guests. The kettle is covered with dirt on the outside. The towels were torn, but they were replaced the next day. The sheet on the bed is small, the mattress is constantly left without a sheet, it is impossible to sleep! The handles on the doors of the bathroom cabinet were sticky, and the washing machine was also dirty. Pros. Lots of equipment.. microwave, TV with internet, router for the room separately. It’s nice to live here, but if you scrub everything yourself. This is a poor service for increased comfort. Owners, think about how much the rating will increase if it is simply clean here.",

And is it normal to rent a room for 580 hryvnia, with an air temperature of +6 and an open window upon check-in?…\nAt the same time, I’ll immediately note that parking is paid +100 hryvnia per night!\nIt all started with an uneducated guy at the reception who has no idea what you’re up to...\nAll check-in takes place over the phone, a guy talks to you on the phone and tells you where to go and give money for the room.\nAnd the one who accepts the money knows a little, but if something happens, he doesn’t have change, so if the room rate is 580, you automatically give him tea for 20 hryvnia.\nWell, these are trifles, then the number.\nWhen checking in, I need to go through another half of the building and find the second entrance, which was indicated by the guy from the reception.\nNext, you take the elevator up an ordinary residential building and look for your room for about 10 minutes.\nWhen I opened the already tired door, I found myself in a room in which the temperature was not particularly different from the temperature at the entrance to the building. I further noted that the window in the room was open, most likely to remove the unpleasant odor that had enveloped the entire room; well, this does not really help save the situation.\nThe whole room looks like a station dump car.\nWith stale bed linen, which you don’t want to sit on even in a jacket and jeans...\nAgain, everything is decided over the phone.\nI did not continue exploring this place and returned the money.\nIt’s a pity that I wasted my time; I had to travel from Kyiv at night without resting.\nI do not recommend it 200%!",

We encountered continuous disadvantages and had an extremely negative experience. Homey Home Inn is not a hotel at all, but individual apartments in a residential building. There is no reception, no administrator, there is not even any person responsible for your check in. It is completely impossible to contact the person whose number is listed on Booking.com, and at the entrance to the building there is only a security guard who takes payment and issues keys and at the same time declares that he does not bear any responsibility and has no relation to this “hotel”. Moreover, you cannot view the “room” before checking in, only if you leave a deposit of 500 UAH (for what??). It turns out that you are paying for a “pig in a poke”, because in fact the “number” does not correspond to the photo on the website. In general, the whole system looks like a deception and some kind of sharashkin’s office. Therefore, we decided not to live in this nasty place and we wholeheartedly do not advise you.",

Especially, the school usually hosts many nice events for students under the surveilance of dynamic marketing team. I had many good friends in the class. I still remember the first day I appeared at the entrance of the class (Well, such an ashamed but I got some problems so I was late), all the class said Hi to me and after the class time, they came and asked if I need any help, feel free to tell them. They are very united, focused on the class and studied so hard that made me admire so much. In addition, the teachers are very qualified. Even the class schedule is quite tight but noone showed off their tiredness or boredom. Instead, the teachers tried to give as much as possilbe their knowledge and passion of dancing for students. There are some teachers I especially like their dance styles or teaching method that – sorry- I can’t remember the Ukrainian name (mr Vobr, the Dance hall teacher, the House teacher, the Break dance teacher,….). Lastly, the academy was organized in 3 months, 6 days per week, 6 hours per day with a very supportive price – as I remember just only around 500usd. It’s very very low price that I know Myway can’t make much profit from this Academy.\n\nI’m the only foreigner in the course. As I heard that many foreigners are scared of the safety and language in the country. I was the same but after crossing nearly 10 countries in the North of Europe,  I felt in love of Kiev – very beautiful, peaceful, safe and good food at very reasonable price.\n\nIn conclusion, I would love to express my special thanks to Myway staff, teachers and especially my classmate who helped me so well in this lonely period of time in your country. Love you all and suggest other dancers in the world should join this special training course: GOOD QUALITY, WELL – ORGANIZED, LOW PRICE, BEAUTIFUL CITY.",

(in normal clinics they said the opposite: first we solve the problem with the gums, then caries)\nI paid 450 UAH and no one even bothered to treat or advise me yet. I asked about Curettage, to which I was told that they do not perform such procedures. although it’s in the price list!! Apparently this doctor does not perform this procedure, and it is not destiny to refer him to a specialist!! I'm just shocked.............",

There were complaints about the fastenings on one mirror, a complaint about a buzzing power supply and a sloppily embedded button on another mirror; crumbs and cracks were visible. After the review, they promptly contacted us, fixed the power supply and beat the button, hiding the shortcomings, returned and hung the mirror. I checked that creating an order works intuitively, a letter arrives in the mail, and the order number is displayed on the website.\n\nHuge selection of mirrors, local operating plant and manufacturer. The mirrors and glass are really interesting, original for different tastes and you can make whatever you want to order. I ordered two mirrors, they look beautiful, there was a defect, but they quickly fixed it.\nI would wish the plant to continue to develop in the field of marketing, advertising and SSM if you plan to grow in the B2C “Business to Client” model, most likely a huge % of sales go to B2B “Business to Business” (huge quantities for offices, restaurants, hotels), because plant, I learned from a friend that he works in the construction and repair business, but Google search does not show the plant on the first page of results and I had never heard of the plant itself before.",

There is also a discount on your next purchase from the assortment.\nI didn’t like it: I looked for an office for a long time, called 3 times to get directions.",

They offered several models, I don’t even remember now. They offered a good price. That is, you can even bargain)). Delivered by new mail the next day after ordering. And the order, by the way, was placed at the end of the working day. The router works without failures (I knock on wood three times). Happy with everything. Communication with the manager, price and delivery speed. And yes, all the documents came with the router. Warranty and setup instructions. The setup is very simple. I connected to the McLaut cable without any problems.",

I have been using CDMA voice communication services for more than 10 years, the communication quality is good, transparent and honest tariffs (only recently for the first time in 10 years they increased and warned about this). Unlike scammers of other mobile operators (Kyivstar, Wobaphone), which forcefully transfer to unfavorable tariffs and steal money from the account, I have not seen this in Intertelecom. In addition, the communication frequencies used by Intertelecom, unlike mobile communications, are more secure. That is why these companies are putting pressure on Intertelecom in every possible way.
