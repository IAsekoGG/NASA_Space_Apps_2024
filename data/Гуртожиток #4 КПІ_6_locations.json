Previously, master's interns could remain until summer as external individuals. Heating is scheduled to be supplied according to the KMDA timeline, around October 15, with a one-week delay for dormitories. Payment for September was based on four residents per room, but from October, it will be calculated based on the actual number of registered residents. If a student moves in mid-month, the payment adjustment will take effect the following month. New washing machines are set to replace the old ones in the dormitories. Surveillance cameras will be installed in the student campus to help reduce the number of illegal residents. The installation of new windows in Dormitory 4 is delayed due to incorrect dimensions.",
