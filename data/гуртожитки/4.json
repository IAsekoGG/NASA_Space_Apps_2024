Heating is scheduled to begin around October 15, with a typical one-week delay for dormitories. September payments were based on four residents per room, but from October, charges will reflect the actual number of registered residents. If a student moves in mid-month, the payment adjustment will take effect the following month. New washing machines are set to replace old ones in the dormitories. Surveillance cameras will be installed on campus to help reduce illegal residents. The installation of new windows in Dormitory 4 is delayed due to incorrect measurements.",
